-Tap Tempo
play: starts playing the sequence, if you press it again the sequence stops. 
rec: start recording what you play, if you press it again, return to play mode 
ctr + some pad: switch between the 4 available sequences 
ctr + play: the sequence plays in reverse 
play + ŕec: delete the sequence 
ctr + rec + some pad: delete this sound from sequence
